# Homelessness-Hackathon

Homelessness in USA 
Purpose of the project
Homelessness is an issue that continues to burden our communities across the globe. While typical discussion around the causes of homelessness can focus on the personal/individual level, it is known that many structural/macro level factors contribute to homelessness.

The goal of this project is to examine macro level factors that a related to homelessness using US data.

Our project idea and objective  is to help people facing homelessness find services in their area, as as well as sign-posting people wanting to help, to where it is needed. The project acts as a gateway into Street Support's broader remit of helping connect organisations, people with lived experience, policy-makers, and businesses to co-produce lasting solutions.
